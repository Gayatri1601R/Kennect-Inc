Write and submit code to set up a handler for a focus-event on an input element having id name which is direct child of an element having id john.
1) When run the handler should add the HTML class shape to all elements having a HTML class of important which are direct children of an element having id john.
2) The event should not propagate beyond the handler.

Solution - 
import './App.css';
import logo from './logo.svg';

function App() {
  function FocusHandler() {
    document.getElementsByClassName('important').style.cssText = 'height:50px; width: 50px; background-color:#555; border-radius:0%; display:block; margin-left:auto; margin-right:auto;'
  }
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <div id='john'>
        <label>
          Name
        </label>
        <input id='name' onFocus={FocusHandler} style={{ margin: '1em' }}>
        </input>
        <label>
          Phone
        </label>
        <input>
        </input>
        <h2>Shape</h2>
        <div className="important">
        </div>
      </div>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


Explain JWT in approx and prove it's top 3 benefits.
solution -
A JSON web token(JWT) is JSON Object which is used to securely transfer information over the web(between two parties). It can be used for an authentication system and 
can also be used for information exchange.The token is mainly composed of header, payload, signature. These three parts are separated by dots(.). JWT defines the structure 
of information we are sending from one party to the another, and it comes in two forms â€“ Serialized, Deserialized.

Top 3 benefits of JWT-
1) JWT are better than session cookies
2) It is stateless, No need to manage sessions.
3) Good performance.

Given a number x, find out if it is a prime number or not, use javascriptand find out the difference between next prime number after x and x.
Solution -

// 'number' will hold a random number in
// the range [0, 99]
const number = Math.floor(Math.random() * 100);

// Declare 'flag' and initialize it to false.
let flag = false;

// Since we know that 1 is neither prime nor composite.
if (number == 1) {
   console.log(" 1 is neither prime nor composite");
}

// This is the condition we are concerned about
// i.e. any positive number greater than 1.
else if (number > 1) {
   // Iterate from 2 to number/2.
   for (let i = 2; i < number / 2; i++) {
      // Check if 'i' divides 'number' without
      // leaving the remainder
      if (number % i == 0) {
         // If yes then set a flag to true
         // and exit from the loop.
         flag = true;
         break;
      }
   }

   // If the flag is found true it means a divisor was found
   // during the iteration.
   if (flag == true) console.log(`${number} is not a prime number`);
   // Otherwise no divisor was found.
   else console.log(`${number} is a prime number`);
}

// If the number is less than 1 (either 0 or negative)
// then we can say it is not a prime number.
else {
   console.log(`${number} is not a prime number`);
}
